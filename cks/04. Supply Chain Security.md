## 1. Minimize Base Image Footprint
Base Image vs Parent Image

Base image is one whose Dockerfile definition is created
```
FROM scratch
```
## 2. Best Practises for Images
1. Modular - **DO NOT** combile multiple apps into one image. Solve one specific problem in each image, eg. web & db. This way, each image can have its won library and can be managed independently without affecting other.

2. No State Persist - **DO NOT** persist/ store data inside container. Containers are meant to be ephemeral in nature; we should be able to destroy and bring them back online without losing data. Always store data in external volume/ cache.

3. Choosing Base Image
   - image should be from official source.
   - image should be getting frequently updated - lesser vulnerabilities.
   - use slim/minimal images - images can be easily pulled and scaled.
   - only install necessary packages in the image.

4. Remove shell/package managers and other tools

5. Maintain different images for different environments. For eg:
   - dev - may include debugging tools
   - prod - lean version
   
## 3. Image Security
Recommended to use private registry. To use this, we need to provide credentials to pull the image using a secret of the type **docker-registry**

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry reg-cred \
  --docker-username=<> \
  --docker-password=<> \
  --docker-server=<> \
  --docker-email=<>
```

To use the above cred to pull the image, we need to pass the secret-name in the `imagePullSecret` field

```
spec:
  containers:
    image: myprivateimage
    imagePullSecret:
      name: reg-cred
```
## 4. Whitelist Registry
Governance should be in place to ensure image are pulled from an approved list of registry only. This can be achieved in several ways:

1. OPA - Use a policy engine like OPA and define rule to pull from an approved registry.
2. Use built-in admission controller **Image Policy Webhook**. For this,
   - Enable and configure the image policy webhook to communicate with adminssion controller server with a configuration file
     
   - Enable the flags in the kube-apiserver
     ```
       --enable-admission-plugins=ImagePolicyWebhook
       --admission-controller-config-file=</etc/kube/config.yaml>
     ```

## 5. Static Analysis of Manifests
Static analysis of manifests helps catch security issues and enforce standards even for deploying the resources. The manifests can be K8s resource definition manifests or Dockerfile.

**Kubesec** is a tool that helps analyse a resource definition file and returns a scire with details of issues that were found in it.

Kubesec can be:
  - installed as a binary and run locally
    ```
    kubesec scan pod.yaml
    ```
  - Send curl request to public kubesec instance
    ```
    curl -sSX POST --data-binary @"pod.yaml" https://v2/kubesec.io/scan
    ```


## 6. Image Scanning
**CVE** - Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures - is a central database of opensource vulnerabilties. 
A vulnerability is anything:
  - that allows an attacker to bypass security and do things a user to not expected to do
  - that messes/interrupts functioning

**Trivy** by AquaSec is an open-source vulnerability scanner that scan for CVEs in the image. It can be easily integrated into CICD as well.

```
trivy image nginx:1.18.0
  --severity=CRITICAL,HIGH  [filter severity]
  --output /root/scan.txt   [report location]
  --ignore-unfixed          [vulnerabilities with no fixes not impacting result]
```

Trivy can also scan the image .tar archive
`trivy image --input alpine.tar --output scan.txt`

**Best Practises:**
  - continuously rescan
  - may include as part of admission controller that scan before deploying the image. This may, however, delay the deployment
  - can have own repo with pre-scanned images. This is reduce time to deploy compared to above.
  - integrate scanning with CICD
